# Blood Donor Database Management System (Python + MySQL)

This project was originally developed as my **Class 12 Computer Science practical project (2023–24)** using **Python and MySQL**.  
It implements a **menu-driven, terminal-based CRUD system** for managing blood donors, medical records, doctors, and donation banks.

This repository motive is to intentionally preserved the code **without refactoring** to maintain the originality and thought process from my early programming journey.

What makes this project special:
- Built completely **from scratch**
- No AI assistance or external frameworks
- Logic, flow, and features were planned manually
- Still works **unchanged after 3+ years** with modern Python & MySQL

## 🧠 Project Overview

The system simulates a **blood donation camp management platform**, supporting:

- User registration (sign-up)
- User login
- Medical history entry and retrieval
- Donation bank information lookup
- Doctor listing and appointment flow
- CLI-based interaction using menus

All operations are performed through the **command-line interface (CLI)**.

- `mysql-connector-python`
- `prettytable` (for tabular CLI output)
